# URL to a loki node's RPC interface.  Should not end in a /.  The node provides all the SN network
# status.  Note that restarting the node will result in a loss of last uptime proof data: if you
# need to restart the node you may want to temporarily switch this to some other, public node for a
# couple hours.  (Restarting the bot, on the other hand, won't reset anything, so changing this,
# restarting the bot, then changing back after 2 hours and restarting again is perfectly fine and
# won't miss any updates).
